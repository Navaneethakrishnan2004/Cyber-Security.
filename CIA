Vulnerability Assesment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)
  VA - Process of identifying, Quantifying and prioting Vulnerabilities within a system, network, application or organaization
  CIA- 
    risk matrix
    2 types:
 High priority - likely would & impact


Vulnerability Assesment process(4)
` Assest discovery
` Vulnerability scanning
` Vulnerability Assesment
` Vulnerability remidiation


CVVS ( common Vulnerability scoring system )
Scalar matricks
none     *0
low      0.1-3.9
medium   4.0-6.9
high     7.0-8.9
critical 9.0-10.0


Vulnerability Scanner types:-
1) Data Vuln. scanner
2) Network Vuln.scanner
3) Web application Vuln.scanner
4) Host-based Vuln.Scanner
5) API- based Vuln.scanner
6) Cloud- based Vuln.scanner



Cyber security terms:-
1) Policy      -   to regulate/control what to be done and how to be done(for governance)
2) Procedure   -   step by step guide how to follow the policy
3) Standard    -   
4) Regulations -  its a government based rules (GDPR)


Benefits: 
Identify security Weakness before exploitation
Prioritizes remidation efforts based on risk severity
supports compilance with regulations and standards
improves overall security posture
provides actionable recommendation


Drawbacks:
Resource intensive
False Positives
False Negatives
Limited Scopes



Six-Process of hacking in PENETRATION TESTING
1) Information gathering
2) Threat Modelling
3) Vulnerability Analysis
4) Exploitation
5) Post-Exploitation
6) Reporting


5 faces of PENETRATION TESTING:
1) Information gathering
2) Scaning
3) Gaining Access
4) Maintaining Access - persistance
5) Clearing Tracks


Types of penetration testing:-
1) Application
2) Network
3) Physical
4) IOT / Mobile
